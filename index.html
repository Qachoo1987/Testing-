                <p>They use their claws and stinger to hunt and kill their prey. Before it stings, a scorpion uses its
                    claws
                    to grab and stabilize the prey. With smaller prey, the animal simply is crushed by the scorpion's
                    grip.
                    Envenomation is the process by which a scorpion uses its tail to inject venom</p>
